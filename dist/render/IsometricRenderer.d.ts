/**
 * IsometricRenderer
 * Owns the fixed-pitch, non-rotating orthographic isometric camera and the
 * main game scene. Delegates resolution/upscale to PixelPipeline, shadow
 * setup to LightingController, and crepuscular rays to GodRayLayer (kept
 * separate per DRIFTER_ENGINE_PLAN.md's class list / rendering deep-dive
 * build order 2.1–2.8) — this class wires them together rather than
 * reimplementing any of their concerns inline.
 *
 * v2 — integrates step 2.4 (LightingController) and 2.5 (GodRayLayer) on
 * top of the v1 M2 scope (empty scene + sky). Both are attached
 * automatically inside attachSky() since they depend on the same
 * directional light SkySystem produces; nothing else changes about how a
 * caller uses this class versus v1 — attachSky()/syncSky()/render() still
 * the only required calls.
 *
 * Camera: classic 2:1 "game isometric" — 45° yaw, ~35.264° pitch (true
 * isometric, matches Octopath/HD-2D convention) rather than an actual 45°
 * pitch, which reads as too steep/top-down for this style. Fixed — no
 * rotation, per the locked DRIFTER lore/build decisions (non-rotating
 * camera was an explicit call in the player sprite system too).
