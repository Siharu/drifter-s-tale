/**
 * SkySystem
 * Procedural sky: hand-authored color keyframes (not generated hue cycle),
 * baked from SVG-style canvas drawing -> THREE.CanvasTexture, per the locked
 * SVG-procedural-generation approach.
 *
 * Drives ambient/fog color from a single source of truth (the sky), per
 * the locked architecture decision in DRIFTER_ENGINE_PLAN.md.
 *
 * v2 — reworked around the Cygnus Signal Series lore:
 *   - WrongnessState replaces the old continuous corruptionOverlay slider.
 *     Discrete, hand-authored progression: SUNNY -> BLUE -> GREY -> RAINY ->
 *     STATIC -> UNKNOWN -> STORMY -> DIFFERENT -> ANOTHER_SKY.
 *     STATIC gets an actual glitch/flicker pass, not just a color shift.
 *   - Moon is now a tracked, persistent object (position/phase/anomaly),
 *     independent of the day/night sunMoon glow — it can be visible (faint)
 *     during the day and is a plot anchor (Moon Dome), not just a light.
 *   - Obsedia Rain (black oil rain / Black Rain / Moon Rain / Starfall) is
 *     a distinct overlay effect: random, unpredictable, bleeds the sky dark
 *     and gooey rather than being tied to a WeatherType.
 *   - Stars + procedural clouds folded in as additional baked layers,
 *     seeded per zone so each Drifter's region reads as visually distinct.
 *
 * Tune colors first in sky_preview.html (update it alongside this file —
 * the math should stay identical on both sides), then port changes here.
