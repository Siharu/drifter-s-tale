/**
 * SVGBuildingFactory
 * Turns a Building (types.ts) into a small "paper diorama" stack of flat
 * planes — front wall, side wall, roof — each with its own procedurally
 * generated SVG facade baked via SVGRasterizer. This is the Octopath
 * Traveler approach: every piece is a flat 2D image on a quad, but
 * arranged in real 3D space so they occlude/shadow correctly from the
 * fixed isometric camera, without ever being true 3D geometry.
 *
 * Everything is generated from the Building's own data (type, size,
 * decayState) plus a seed — no image assets, per the locked
 * SVG-procedural-generation decision. Different BuildingTypes get
 * different window/detail rules so a WAREHOUSE reads differently from
 * a SIGNAL_TOWER without any hand-placed content.
